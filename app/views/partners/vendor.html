    <h3>Be a Vendor</h3>

    <div  class="md-body-1">
        <p>Vendors are people who reserve a table through the entire convention
        (this year it is only two days, but will be three days in subsequent years.
        Unlike with the Bazaar, we manage our vendors, so that there isn't too much overlap
        between what they sell.    Vendors get a free table at the Bazaar.
        The cost to be a vendor this year is $25.</p>

        <p>Exchange links, banners and/or flyers</p>
        <p>Referring links between websites is a great way to maximize your SEO.</p>
